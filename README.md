# The Testism Framework

## Framework for software testing and debugging.

Purpose:
  - Be accessible through shared libraries for language compatibility.
  - Allow testing of executable files through a runtime environment (?).
  - Allow testing based on hardware failure simulation (runtime).
  - Decrease debugging time.
  - Increase debugging efficiency.
  - Be widely accessible by a well-documented API.
  - Be self-tested.
  - Be Accessible to all.

__Note:__ Please read the [Testism Manifesto](TheTestismManifesto.md).

### Near-future goals:
  - Build a community of like-minded software engineers.
  - Finish the conception of the Testism Manifesto to clearly define what this project is and will be part of.
  - Make first testing capabilities.
