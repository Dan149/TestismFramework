# Testism

## Introduction

Initial issue:
	All software is bug-prone, erronous and unconstant in its execution.
	Thus, it's difficult to debug a failing process, find and reproduce an encountered error and fix it.

Question:
	How to significantly reduce debugging time and increase its effectiveness ?

Answer:
	Testism.

What is Testism ?
	Firstly, Testism is a concept that allows software which architecture follows the Testism Tenets to be debugged in a safer and faster way.
	Secondly, Testism aims to become an implementation of its Tenets (Testism Framework), allowing software debugging in several programming languages via shared libraries.

## Testism Tenets

Testism Tenets (or TTs, no pun intended) are the axioms to follow when programming software. Besides making said software less bug-prone, they aim to offer a future easy usage of the Testism Framework for better debugging.

Hence, thou shall live by the following rules:

1. All software process must have a deterministic layer.
